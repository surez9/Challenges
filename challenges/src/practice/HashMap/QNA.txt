Questions related to HashMap.

    1. Which data structure HashMap represents?
    Ans: Hash Table data structure,
        (key,value) pair
        O(1) time if we have the key.

    2. Which data structure is used to implement HashMap in Java?
    Ans: Array and LinkedList
        Array to store bucket. Inside bucket data is stored in linkedlist manner(i.e mappings which land in the same bucket)

    3. Is HashMap thread-safe in Java?
    Ans: No, HashMap is not thread safe
         Multiple thread can access same object

    4. What will happen if you use HashMap in a multithreaded Java application?
    Ans: When multiple threads access the HashMap then they can modify the data at sametime.
        Concurrent HashMap can be used in new Java ver

    5. How do you remove a mapping while iterating over HashMap in Java?
    Ans: remove() of iterator
        e.g Iterator itr = map.entrySet().iterator();
            while(itr.hasNext()){
                Map.Entry current = itr.next();
                if(current.getKey.equals("matching")){
                itr.move();
                }
            }

    6. What is the load factor in HashMap?
    Ans: Number that controls the resizing of the hashMap(internal table).

    7. How many entries you can store in HashMap? What is the maximum limit?
    Ans: No limit for HashMap.
        size() return int -> limit -- out of size case if no of entries increases so there is new method
        in JDK 8 by adding mappingCount() return long value

    8. What is the difference between the capacity and size of HashMap in Java?
    Ans: Capacity: how many entries HashMap can store
         size: entries currently present

    9. What is ConcurrentHashMao in Java?
    Ans: Map implementation, which can be safely used in a concurrent and multi-threaded Java program.
        Performance and Scalability of ConcurrentHashMap is high as Compared to Hashtable.

    10. Can you store in duplicate key in HashMap?
    Ans: No,

    11. Can you store the duplicate value in Java HashMap?
    Ans: Yes

    12. In which order mappings are stored in HashMap?
    Ans: No order, hash and index calculated using key

    13. What will happen if two different keys of HashMap return the same hashcode()?
    Ans: Hash Collision, goes to bucket uses linkedlist
        if any performance issues changes to binary tree.

    14. When does ConcurrentModificationException occur?
    Ans: Multiple thread modifying same object
